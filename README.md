# cerebroApp

R package upon which the [Cerebro](https://github.com/romanhaa/Cerebro) is built.

Make sure to install the package using `BiocManager::install()` because `devtools::install_github()` will otherwise pull old versions of dependencies that can result in errors.

```r
BiocManager::install("romanhaa/cerebroApp")
```

For further details, please refer to the official [Cerebro](https://github.com/romanhaa/Cerebro) repository.
