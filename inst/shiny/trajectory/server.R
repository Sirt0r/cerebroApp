## Tab: Trajectory.

# what needs to be done
# - check if trajectory data is available
# - if not, display a message
# - if yes, merge with rest of meta data (so cells can be colored by whatever)
#   - maybe just merge with those cells that info is available for? not ideal
# - plot trajectory with ggplot -> plotly
# - second plot to show selected meta data over pseudotime
# - let user show gene expression as well? probably more complicated
